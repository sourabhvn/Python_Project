Health is very important for any Human Being. Doctor often refers his patients to go and 
get tested for certain parameters in the diagnostic labs. So it has been a challenge for the 
technicians working in the diagnostic labs to handle the process efficiently. My project uses 
python programming language and MySQL Database as backend and has the functionalities where the technician can add, 
update, delete and display the information of the patient. And also various human 
parameters such as Haemoglobin level, Blood Glucose level, BMI, Lipid Profile etc can be 
calculated and entered into the portal by the results obtained from the various tests
conducted.
The project has the following objectives:
▪ Calculate the results of various parameters of the body from the inputs received by 
the tests. Ex: Blood profile, Lipid Profile etc
▪ Add the information of the patients coming to the Diagnostic lab.
▪ Update the information of the patient if required.
▪ Display the information of the patients.
▪ Delete the information of the patients if required

 CONCLUSION
The project titled ‘Wellbeing Diagnostic Portal’ is developed to be used in diagnostic 
labs with the help of python and DBMS. The system was tested and the performance 
of the system was found to be acceptable. All the necessary output was created. The 
project is user-friendly and can be understood by any of the admins who work in the 
diagnostics lab. This project hopefully will be good mode for all the data works that 
involve in the diagnostic labs
